<h5 id="steps-to-make-guacamole-shrimp-cucumber-bites">Steps to make Guacamole Shrimp Cucumber Bites:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Devein the shrimp and peel the shells and tail off (if shrimp is not already deveined and peeled). Add paprika, salt and pepper and toss gently to get an even coat on all shrimp. Set aside for 15 minutes. (wash hands after touching the raw shrimp)</li>
<li>Cut the avocados, remove the pit and the outer skin. Place in a bowl (separate from the shrimp) then mash the avocados. They do not have to be completely mashed as some bits can provide texture.</li>
<li>Dice the red onion. Size of the dice can be to your liking. For picky eaters a small dice can make them hard to find while a large dice can highlight the onion for onion lovers. Dice the Jalapeno. Chop the parsley very fine. Add the onions, jalapenos, and parsley to the mashed avocado.</li>
<li>(optional) zest the lime and 1/2 of the lemon and add to the mashed avocado.</li>
<li>Cut the lime in half and squeeze the juice into the smashed Avocado mixture (which I will call Guacamole from this point on). then squeeze the 1/2 lemon to add the lemon juice as well. NOTE: you will want to squeeze through a strainer or through your hands to prevent any seeds from getting into the Guacamole. Mix well to combine.</li>
<li>Squeeze the remaining lime and lemon juice into a separate container, be careful to remove any seeds that may fall in. Set aside, we will use this juice once the shrimp are cooked.</li>
<li>Grab a large or medium saucepan and set on the heat to medium or medium-low (depending on your stove). Allow the pan to heat up empty for 3-5 minutes. Add the butter to the pan, you should see it melt quickly but not immediately darken and brown. Small bubbles in the butter are ok.</li>

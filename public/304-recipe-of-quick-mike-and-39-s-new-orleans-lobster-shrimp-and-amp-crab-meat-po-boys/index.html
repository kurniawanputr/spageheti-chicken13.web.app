<li>1 lb raw Rock Lobster pictured. Rinse and set to the side. Prepare to steam them later.</li>
<li>Cut lobsters down the middle of the upper shell with sharp kitchen shears.</li>
<li>1 lb Pre-steamed Jumbo Shrimp. Rinse, de-shell, de-vein if needed, rough chop and add to your large bowl with Langistino tails.</li>
<li>I use fresh pre-steamed crab claws. Just crack open and shread meat. Add to large bowl.</li>
<li>But, [real] canned crab meat works as well. If opting for canned - drain and carefully sift thru it for any shells.</li>
<li>In a pan with a lifted rack and tight fitting lid - add these ingredients to taste. Butter - White Wine - Minced Garlic - Fresh Lemon Juice - Lemon Pepper - Old Bay and bring all to a simmer. Add what you'd like and how you'd like it but don't allow your fluids to rise above your rack and touch your lobster tails. You want to steam - not boil.</li>
<li>Drizzle a bit of your melted sauce on top of your lobster tails and into the slits you made earlier. Steam with tight fitting lid for 7 to 8 minutes. Don't peek tho! ;0)</li>
<li>Pull lobster tails, de-shell and rough chop meat. I'll always use the leftover lobster butter juices for a quick, simple steamed Baby Ukon Gold Potato, white onion and green pepper dish. Waste not want not right?</li>
<li>Use 12&quot; Leidenheimer loaves if you want an authentic NOLA Po Boy. Be sure to lightly toast them! 😆</li>
<li>Simply place seafood atop crispy butter leaf lettuce and French buns. Also, serve with hot sauce and chilled pickles to the side.</li>
<li>If opting to put your seafood mixture on toasted bagles - simply toast and smear cream cheese at base.</li>
<li>Add a piece of butter leaf lettuce - add seafood mixture with a squeeze of lemon - then another piece of lettuce to keep your bread nice and crunchy!</li>
<li>Viola!</li>
<li>Quite possibly the BEST chilled pickles out there! They're firm and crazy delicious! You'll only find them in your refrigerated isle of your local chain supermarket.</li>
<li>Enjoy this tiny extra rich little taste of NOLA y'all!</li>
